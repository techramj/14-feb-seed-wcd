Statement

PreparedStatement


CallableStatement


method:
   execute():boolean  =>  for all type of query (dml/ddl/dcl)
     insert => false
     update => false
     delete => false
     select  => true

Java 7:
   multicatch
   try with resource
   diamond feature List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
   string in switch case
   
   switch(long){
   	case 1;
   }
   
   
   int a = 10;
   int b = 10;
   switch (a) {
	case b:
   }
   
   
   
   

 
Emp
 id : sequence => emp_seq
 name
 salary
 
 
 public Employee  addEmployee(Employee emp){
  //logic
 
 }
 
 main(){
   Employee emp1 = new Employee("Jack", 5000);
   Employee addedEmp = dao.addEmployee(emp1);
  //addedEmp  id:1, name:jack, salary:5000
 }
 



ResultSet rs;

//how many cols, what are the type, name of columns



 //add 100 rows
 
 List<Employee> list; //100 employees
 
 for(Employee emp:list){
 	ps.setInt
 }
 
 
 
 
 Assignment:
1. Add 10000 record using batch update with PreparedStatement
 batch size = 500;
 
 1  Jack-00001 1000
 2  Jack-00002 1001
 3  Jack-00003 1002
 .
 .
 10000 Jack-10000 11000
 
 
2. query to update the salary by 1000 to the employee whose name end with 5
update emp set salary = salary + ? where last_name like '%5';
 
3. delete the employees who name end with 3
delete emp where last_name like '%3';

4. display the employees whose salary is multiple of 1000
 select * from emp where mod(salary,1000) =  0;
